// Virtual Machine instruction to Hack assembly sequence test frame.
// Copy your Hack assembly code down below and single step this program
// with the CPUEmulator to test that your Hack assembly is the correct
// translation of a given single Virtual Machine instruction.

// For a complete test, run a second time with the stack base and any
// segment bases used moved to different memory address.

// Establish the stack base at address 24 and simulate the following two
// virtual machine instructions:
//    push constant 42
//    push constant 220

@42 // simulate push constant 42
D=A
@24
M=D

@220 // simulate push constant 220
D=A
@25
M=D

@26 // set SP to 26
D=A
@SP
M=D

// Set any needed segment registers here, as needed.  Ensure that 
// segments don't overlap.  Remember that the static segement starts
// at address 16.
// Example: set LCL base to 32
@32
D=A
@LCL
M=D

// Put your Hack assembly code here.
