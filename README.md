# Computer-Architecture
A semester-long series of projects from my CS220 (Computer Architecture) class at Goucher College.
This course served as introduction to the organization of contemporary computing systems: instruction
set design, arithmetic circuits, control, the memory hierarchy and I/O. In this prject-based course,
I learnt to implement a computer system from the chip set to the computer architecture. I also implemented
translators for assembly and virtual machine programs, using a stack architecture used
by many high-level languages.

Project Outline:
Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
Project 2: Combinational Chips
Project 3: Sequential Chips
Project 4: Machine Language Programming
Project 5: Computer Architecture
Project 6: Assembler
Project 7: Virtual Machine Translator I
Project 8: Virtual Machine Translator II
